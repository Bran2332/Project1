Attrition, in Human Resource terminology, refers to the phenomenon of the employees leaving the company. Attrition in a company is usually measured with a metric called attrition rate, which simply measures the no of employees moving out of the company (voluntary resigning or laid off by the company). Attrition Rate is also referred as churn rate or turnover.

Questions we must answer: 
1. What factors drive employee attrition?
2. What makes employees stay or  leave?
3. Is commute contributing to attrition the most?
