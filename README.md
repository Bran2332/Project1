Attrition in a company is usually measured with a metric called attrition rate, which simply measures the no of employees moving out of the company (voluntary resigning or laid off by the company). Attrition Rate is also referred as churn rate or turnover.

The company loses on the amount it spent to recruit and select these employees and to train them for their respective jobs.
