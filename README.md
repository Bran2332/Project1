Employee Attrition Analytics (EAA) is the process of analyzing data to determine the causes of employee turnover in an organization. EAA allows organizations to identify potential risk areas or areas for improvement, such as high turnover rates in specific departments or job roles. 

By addressing these issues, businesses can improve employee morale, lower turnover costs, and ultimately build a more successful and sustainable business. 
Why these matters: Understanding what kinds of employees leave the company helps to retain talent and prevent burnout. This saves the costs of training new hires and invests in building long-term expertise in the company.

The group was interested in understanding how income, promotions, and potential burnout, could impact employee attrition.
