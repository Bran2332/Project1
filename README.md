Employee Attrition Analytics (EAA) is the process of analyzing data to determine the causes of employee turnover in an organization. EAA allows organizations to identify potential risk areas or areas for improvement, such as high turnover rates in specific departments or job roles. 

By addressing these issues, businesses can improve employee morale, lower turnover costs, and ultimately build a more successful and sustainable business. 
Why these matters: Understanding what kinds of employees leave the company helps to retain talent and prevent burnout. This saves the costs of training new hires and invests in building long-term expertise in the company.

The group was interested in understanding how income, promotions, and potential burnout, could impact employee attrition.

•	Statistical analysis (correlation, linear regression)



# Conclusion:

Single employees have the highest rate of attrition in the Marital Status category (left). At the end of the spectrum, a divorced employee will most likely stay at a job. The pie chart also points out, the Married employee will also likely engage in attrition more than a divorced employee but less frequently than the Single employee. From the above pie chart on the left, we can see the attrition rate based on Marital status of employees from highest to lowest as Singles, Married and then Divorced employees.
